🎬 Movie Recommendation System with Sentiment Analysis
📌 About
This Movie Recommendation System suggests movies based on user preferences and performs sentiment analysis on reviews. Built using Flask, Python, JavaScript, and Machine Learning, it provides:

Personalized movie recommendations using Cosine Similarity
Movie details including descriptions, actors, and trailers
Sentiment analysis using Naïve Bayes with TF-IDF to classify reviews
This project combines NLP, AI, and web technologies to enhance user experience in exploring movies! 🚀

🔹 Features
✅ Movie Recommendations – Get similar movie suggestions based on content
✅ Detailed Movie Info – View descriptions, actors, and trailers
✅ Sentiment Analysis – Analyze audience reviews for insights
✅ Interactive UI – Built with Flask and JavaScript

🔹 Tech Stack
Python (Flask, Scikit-learn, NLTK, NumPy, Pandas)
Machine Learning (Cosine Similarity for recommendations, Naïve Bayes for sentiment analysis)
Natural Language Processing (NLP) (TF-IDF for text vectorization)
JavaScript, HTML, CSS for frontend
MySQL for storing movie data

🔹 How It Works
1️⃣ Movie Recommendation:

Uses Cosine Similarity to compare movie tags and recommend similar titles.
2️⃣ Sentiment Analysis:

Uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Naïve Bayes Classification to classify reviews as positive or negative.
X = TF-IDF transformed reviews (features)
y = Sentiment labels (target)
